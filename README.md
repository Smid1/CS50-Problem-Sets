# CS50 Problem Sets
This repository contains a set of problems of each week of the 2025 CS50 Harvard program.

Those problems are related to each week content and made for training coding.

Program content:
  - Week 0 - Scratch
  - Week 1 - C
  - Week 2 - Arrays
  - Week 3 - Algorithms
  - Week 4 - Memory
  - Week 5 - Data Structures
  - Week 6 - Python
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Week 7 - SQL
  - Week 8 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Week 9 - Flask
  - Week 10 - Cybersecutiry (2024) and The End (2025)

### Week 1 - Credit
The purpose is to write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.

Also, before that, there was another problem to be resolved for those who were not so comfortable programming, I solved it as well. However, as it was too simple (code a program that gives the minimum amount of coins to give as a change of a <$1 buy) I chose not to put in here.

### Week 2 - Scrabble
That time we had to write a program about the Scrabble game.

For those that are unfamiliar with Scrabble (as I was), it is a game that gives a certain score for each player's words based on the values of each letter.
The program should do exactly what the game is all about by typing the player's words, and then prompt who won or if it was a tie.

### Week 2 - Caesar
This time the program should enable you to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher (a cypher based on a key and each letter has a value, by adding the key value to each letter). 

At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime.

### Week 2 - Substitution
Now we have to encrypt messages again, but now, we provide a command-line argument that will be the entire key.

By providing, for exemple, the key = YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO, the message is encripted following the sequence, where:
A = Y
B = T
C = C
...
